# ham-spam-text-predictor
 It is a Supervised machine learning FreeCodeCamp project with Python to predict if a sms is ham or spam. The project provide us with 2 datasets in .csv: one for training and the other for testing. After checking data, cleaning if needed, categorizing the variable, I have study the lenght text and the main words repeated in text to detect the main difference between ham or spam. Then, I have tokenized the message, and padded it. Later, I created the Dense model, with 4 layers, In the first network layer, the input is 5000 (dimension of word vocabulary) and output of 50. So on, until last layer with input of 256 and output 1. I compile and fit the model with "adam". Later, I iterated with 20 epochs getting in the last one a "lost" near 0,0012. I created a couple of plots to display loss and accuracy. And finally, I created a function to predict new introduced text.
